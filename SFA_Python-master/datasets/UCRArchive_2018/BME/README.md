# BME dataset

BME is a synthetic data set with three classes:  one class is characterized by a small positive bell arising at the initial period (Begin), one does not have any bell (Middle), one has a positive bell arising at the final period (End).

All series are constituted by a central plate. The central plates may be positive or negative. The discriminant is the presence or absence of a positive peak, or at the beginning of series or at the end.
