# ArrowHead

The ArrowHead data consist of outlines of the images of arrowheads. The shapes of the projectile points are converted into a time series using the angle-based method. The classification of projectile points is an important topic in anthropology. The classes are based on shape distinctions such as the presence and location of a notch in the arrow. The problem in the repository is a length normalised version of that used by Ye and Keogh [1]. The three classes are called "Avonlea", "Clovis" and "Mix"."
