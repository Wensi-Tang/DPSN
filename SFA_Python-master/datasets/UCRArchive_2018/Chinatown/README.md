# PedestrianCountingSystem dataset

The City of Melbourne, Australia has developed an automated pedestrian counting system to better understand pedestrian activity within the municipality, such as how people use different city locations at different time of the day. The data analysis can facility decision making and urban planning for the future. 

We extract data of 10 locations for the whole year 2017. We make two datasets from these data.
